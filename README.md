## 🛠️ Neighborhood/Campus Help Hub


A full-stack community-powered platform that connects people with problems to people with solutions, built with ❤️ by students, for students (and neighbors too).

## 🚀 Overview


Help Hub is a real-time assistance platform that allows users to:

🆘 Post problems they need help with (e.g., broken tap, forgotten key, or tech issues)

🧰 Sign up as a Helper to offer their skills and earn trust (or even some cash)

🔐 Authenticate securely using Supabase

🧭 Navigate role-specific dashboards for a clean user experience

This project is perfect for small communities, college campuses, or neighborhoods where people want to help each other and build a stronger support network.



## 🔑 Features
✅ Role-based authentication (Helper / Help Seeker)

✅ Real-time data updates with Supabase

✅ Clean dashboard UI for both user types

✅ Easy sign-up with email, username, and password

✅ Login using just username and password

✅ Built for scalability & future features (like chat, ratings, etc.)

 

## 🧠 How It Works
User chooses a role during signup (Helper or Help Seeker)

Registers with email, username, and password

Supabase stores the user data and authenticates them

User is redirected to their role-specific dashboard

Help Seekers can post problems; Helpers can view and respond to nearby requests

 

## 🌱 Future Enhancements
💬 In-app messaging between users

🌍 Location-based help suggestions

⭐ Ratings and feedback system

📱 Mobile-first PWA optimization
